<section id="about" markdown="1">

Hi there 👋 I'm Zitian. I'm a graduating Ph.D. in bioinformatics. 
I'm super interested in how computational genomics and biomedical informatics help translate research findings to clinical outcomes. 
I'm a strong problem-solver, communicator, and collaborator passionate about translating bioinformatics research into real-world solutions.
Happy to connect via LinkedIn!

**I am actively looking for full-time bioinformatics scientist position starting summer 2026. Feel free to reach out via email to discuss any potential opportunities.**
